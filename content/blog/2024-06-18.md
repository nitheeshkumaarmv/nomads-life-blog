> Sometimes, the best trips are the ones we don‚Äôt plan. 

Last weekend, I felt the need to escape the routine and rejuvenate my soul. The plan was simple ‚Äî a solo day trip to Ooty, followed by a bus ride to Gudalur via the scenic routes of Pykara, with a possibility of exploring Masinagudi before returning to Coimbatore. However, a casual conversation with my friend Dominic the night before changed everything ‚Äî he decided to join me on this impromptu adventure.

**15th June 2024 ‚Ä¢ Saturday**

Our day began early around 5:30 AM as we had to reach the New Bus Stand to catch the bus to Ooty. By 7:30 AM, we boarded and settled into a two-seater ‚Äî him by the window, taking in the views, while I sat beside him, drifting in and out of sleep with my headphones on, lost in soothing melodies. By 10:30 AM, we reached Ooty, only to be greeted with an unexpected twist ‚Äî buses to Gudalur were fully packed, with long queues of eager travelers waiting for the next one. To add to our woes, our stomachs started rumbling, so we decided to grab a quick breakfast at a nearby hotel. With only dosa and a little sambar left on the menu, we made do and re-evaluated our plan.

Determined not to let the trip go to waste, my eyes caught sight of a TNSTC SWB bus with board _"Ooty to Hiriyaseegai via Manjoor"_. A quick Google search revealed that Hiriyaseegai is the last village on the Ooty-Kerala border, with multiple hairpin bends on the way. Intrigued and excited by the unknown, we decided to hop on, setting out on an unplanned adventure to a remote and unexplored destination.

The bus departed, and for just ‚Çπ49 per person, we were on our way to what would turn out to be an unforgettable heavenly experience. Unsure of the return timings, we inquired with the conductor, but his Tamil dialect was a bit difficult to follow. Fortunately, a kind uncle onboard helped us understand ‚Äî the bus to Hiriyaseegai runs only at **6 AM, 11 AM, 1:30 PM, and 5 PM**. With limited bus services and the village being extremely remote, we decided it would be safest to return on the same bus.

Securing a window seat, we sat back to enjoy the cool breeze and the breathtaking scenery. The route took us through **Lovedale, Kundah, Manjoor, Thaishola, and Kinnakorai**, covering approximately **60 km in 3.5 hours**. The journey was nothing short of mesmerizing‚Äîlush green tea estates, rolling hills, and mist-covered valleys at every turn.

One of the highlights was crossing Ramaiya Bridge, which offers a majestic view of Kundha Dam on the right. The first major stop was Manjoor, a bustling little town and the last main junction before Hiriyaseegai. We stepped off the bus for a short break and had hot & crispy vadas and my favourite black tea infused with mint leaves ‚Äî a perfect match for the cold weather.

As we resumed our journey, we noticed curious glances from fellow passengers. When we mentioned our destination, they seemed surprised. It turned out that Hiriyaseegai is a tiny Badaga-speaking village, surrounded by dense Shola forests within the Attapadi Reserve. Conversations with locals made the trip even more intriguing‚Äîthe bus conductor recounted his encounters with tigers, leopards and bison along the route, while another passenger told us about an abandoned road from Coimbatore via Karamadai, Geddhai, and Mulli that is now inaccessible due to frequent wildlife activity. This piqued my interest, adding yet another spot to my future travel bucket list.

As we neared Thaishola, the scenery became even more captivating. With endless tea plantations, the town had a few cottages and guest houses, making it the last possible stay option before reaching the deep jungle. We soon reached a fork in the road ‚Äî left led to Hiriyaseegai, while the right went to Kora Kundha and Upper Bhavani Reservoir, a restricted zone for tourists. Taking the left, we entered the dense forested stretch leading to our final destination.

By this point, the bus was nearly empty, with only two other passengers with us. We moved to the last seat to soak in the surreal views. The dense forest surrounded us, with thick mist rolling over the road, reducing visibility. The chilly breeze and the eerie silence made it feel more like an early morning than an afternoon bus ride.

Approaching Kinnakorai, we passed a spectacular viewpoint ‚Äî a narrow road running along a ridge, with deep valleys on both sides. Unfortunately, traveling by bus meant missing out on stopping for photos, but if you're ever on this route, don‚Äôt forget to capture this breathtaking spot!

After navigating the steep hairpin bends, we reached the end of road at Hiriyaseegai around 2:30 PM. The only ones left onboard were us, the bus driver, and the conductor. With a chuckle, the driver asked us if we were lost, amused by our unusual choice of destination.

Stepping off the bus, we found ourselves in an eerily quiet village with just a handful of houses and no visible signs of people. The silence was profound, broken only by the rustling leaves and distant bird calls. It was a peaceful yet slightly haunting experience. We took some quick selfies as souvenirs and hopped back on the same bus for our return journey.

The bus stopped by Manjoor and we had to switch bus to Ooty. Exhausted but content, we reached Ooty around 7 PM and treated ourselves to a well-deserved dinner near the bus stand. Before leaving, we picked up some homemade chocolates‚Äîa must-buy from Ooty‚Äîbefore catching the night bus back to Coimbatore.

##### Final Thoughts ‚Äì A Hidden Gem Worth Exploring
This unplanned adventure turned out to be one of the best and most memorable trips I've had. The road to Hiriyaseegai is perfect for those who love:
- ‚úÖ Winding roads with hairpin bends
- ‚úÖ Lush green forests and tea estates
- ‚úÖ Chilly mountain weather
- ‚úÖ Remote, unexplored destinations

However, it‚Äôs important to note the dangers of this route ‚Äî wild animal encounters are common, and bus services are extremely limited. If you're traveling here, plan your return in advance and remember that the last main town with food and accommodations is Manjoor.

Hiriyaseegai may not be a popular tourist destination, but for those who seek the thrill of untouched wilderness, it is truly a hidden treasure of Ooty.

Would I go back? Absolutely! But next time, I‚Äôd explore the lesser-known routes around Geddhai, Upper Bhavani and stop by Kinnakorai viewpoint. Adventure is always calling! üöçüå≤‚ú®
